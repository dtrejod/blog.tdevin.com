# Abstract

Speech recognition software regarding gender identification usually revolves
around finding the fundamental frequency of the signal. In this approach, we
find trends in the spacing of fundamental frequency content for human speakers
using a windowed approach. A classifier is implemented based on trends
discovered from a small set of audio files.
