# Abstract

Creating a variable sampled signal allows for conservation of bandwidth and
power however it removes the ability to accurately find a Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT). A requirement of the DFT is that the signal itself by
uniformly sampled. In this paper we show how it is possible to find the DFT
using interpolation. Interpolation is a process of estimating intermediate
sample values from the surrounding samples resulting in a constantly sampled
signal. From an interpolated version of the signal we can once again find the
DFT of the original signal.
