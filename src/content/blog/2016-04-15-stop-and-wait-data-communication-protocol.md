# Summary

Today we introduce the stop-and-wait sliding window transmission method
and compare the performance for difference values of window size and
sequence size. We find that a window size that is too small decreases
performance but having a window size that is too big introduces the
probability that errors will occur during transmission. From testing
multiple parameters we find that a windows size of 04 produces the results
with the fastest transmission for our 26 packet long test message.
