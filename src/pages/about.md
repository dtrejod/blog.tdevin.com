My name is Devin Trejo. I'm currently employed as a software engineer at
Palantir Technologies specializing in infrastructure and observability. I
graduated Temple University in 2016 with a bachelors of Science in Electrical
Engineering. I previously was employed at Susquehanna International Group, a
high frequency trading firm, working within the UNIX platform development team.
